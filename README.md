Project Description: An app for a start up to quickly share remote employee contact info.

Project Features:

- Gets 12 random people from the Rand User API and displays them in cards on the page.
- You can click on any card to get a pop up modal that displays more detailed information.
- You can search the page by employee name.
- While in the modals you can click to move to the previous employee or the next employee.
- Modals have close buttons and also if you click "outside" of the modal it will close.

Listed changes to styles/css in the app:

- Created a class .disabled-btn to have a good visual when you get to the beginning or end of the list of employees when you are in the modal.
- Created a class .no-results to format my results message when there are no search results found.
- Changed border-radius to get a rounded search bar in .search-input
- Changed border-radius to get a rounded submit search button in .search-submit
- Changed the font to Raleway.
- Changed the background color, card color, and modal color to tones of blue.
